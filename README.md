# smartGarbage

Smart-Garbage’s image classification model was implemented on Jupyter Notebook using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model was trained on jpeg images of materials such as plastic, metal, paper and glass, with a binary output of “1” if the material was recyclable, and “0” if not.
